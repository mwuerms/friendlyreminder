# Friendly Reminder

## what this is about

## ideas

### use different programs

1. on/off: paper in (open): on, paper out (closed): off
2. color (rgb) to blink/cycle through
   1. red (r)
   2. yellow (rg)
   3. green (g)
   4. cyan (gb)
   5. blue (b)
   6. magenta (rb)
3. speed, open: slow, closed: fast

example: red -> yellow -> cyan -> magenta -> red

### Programming using paper

use spring contacts (normaly closed, NC) to GND or VCC, open or leave closed when entering the paper to program 

contact example: [2329497-2](https://www.mouser.ch/ProductDetail/571-2329497-2), [datasheet](https://www.mouser.ch/datasheet/2/418/7/ENG_CD_2329497_A2-2033568.pdf)

use:

1. spring contact is on the bottom, plane (GND or VCC) on top.
2. spring contact touches plane on top slightly, lightly, thus closes the contact.
3. Push a paper between plane and spring contact to open the contact on purpose.
